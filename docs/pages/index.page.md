# VPage

> VPage is a _fast_, _modern_ and _flexible_ website starter.

Even large websites are eventually made up of pages. Before you get lost in words like React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt.js, you should really step back a little, and start from the most basic: **pages**.

With both simplicity and extendibility in mind, we designed VPage to help you start a website, without the distraction of techinical details, limitation of specific toolings, and hassle of configuration.

To name a few, [VPage](https://github.com/lem0nle/vpage) helps you:

* Focus on page content by writing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for each page.
* Take full control over your page [design](https://tailwindcss.com/) to show more personality. No themes, no configurations, but still look beautiful.
* Organize your page structure with [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org) components.
* Enjoy fast and intuitive developer experience, while having production-ready end results.

Let's get started from the [Installation](/docs/installation) section.
