## Warning⚠️
Environmentally friendly recycling sounds like such a wonderful thing, right? Unfortunately, Recycle is so far a **fake** project made to demonstrate the usage of our website starter [VPage](https://github.com/lem0nle/vpage). Links listed in **Installation** and **Getting Started** are not real, but we do hope you enjoying making your own real website with [VPage](https://github.com/lem0nle/vpage).
