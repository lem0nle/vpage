## About  Recycle's Software Licenses
Recycle uses the MIT license for its simplicity and compatibility. As a permissive free software license, the MIT license puts only very limited restriction on reuse, modification and distribution. Thus, the MIT License is compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU GPL. Any software licensed under the terms of the MIT License can be integrated with software licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

## Application and Data Security
The Recycle Team takes security very seriously and we architect our applications with the security of your data in mind. Our software is designed to work without requiring users to connect to any servers, including our own. Many users choose to connect to our software update server to regularly check for application updates but this is optional and does not expose any of your document data.
