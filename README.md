[VPage](https://github.com/lem0nle/vpage) is a _modern_, _light_ and _flexible_ front-end template built on Vite for developing web sites.

## Features
* Well organized code directory
* Good guidance and examples
* State-of-the-art infrastructure
* Easy to deploy

## Get started
VPage is designed for quickly building a static website to place your personal homepage, display a project or promote a product, 
but also very suitable to expand into more dynamic and complex front-end projects.

### Install
#### Use Github template
You can simply [use this template]() to create your own repo on Github.

#### Create locally
Or, create a local project with this template.

```bash
npx degit lem0nle/vpage my-page
cd my-page
npm install
```

### Usage
#### Deploy on Github or Netlify
If you wish to deploy on Github Pages, simply use this template to create a repo called `<your-github-username>.github.io`. 
To deploy on netlify, visit [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and select your cloned Vpage template. 
Either way the web wite should be deployed automatically.

#### Run it locally
Run the following command and check http://localhost:3000.
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Philosophy
Configuring things repeatedly sucks.
